      <p>I like to approach the dreaded question that you usually get in interviews, 'Tell me about yourself?',  in a lightning round type of format. While you, dear reader, may not be here to interview me, I am a creature of habit (look I am telling you about myself already), so here goes nothing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My name is Merridith</li>
        <li>I am 19 years old</li>
        <li>I am an avid reader and an extremely serious Harry Potter fan</li>
        <li>I have played soccer since....as long as I can remember</li>
        <li>My goal in life is to be multilingual - I'm talking fluent, in at least five languages</li>
        <li>I'm an extremely sarcastic human being, but that multilingual thing is dead serious.</li>
        <li>I am the oldest of five girls. So is my mom.</li>
        <li>I enjoy movies, long walks on the beach, and cliches. </li>
        <li>My current addiction is anything made by Odwalla, specifically their juices.</li>
        <li>My ideal vacation is camping. Always camping.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="nothomepagecontentbigdiv" id="educationcontentiam">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I am currently a Mechanical Engineering major in my second year at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>

      <h2>Professional</h2>
      <p>If I am being perfectly honest, I am still trying to figure this one out. I came into the engineering field with the goal of working on prosthetics. While they still hold a majority of my interest, my time at IIT has pulled my eyes towards a lot of different areas in the field. I've developed a passion for transportation efficiency, bio-inspired design, and water resource engineering.</p>
