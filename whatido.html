      <p>You may already know some of this from the 'I AM' section of my website, so feel free to skim.</p>
      <p>I spend a lot of my free time with my family. I have four younger sisters and so does my mom. My granparent's live right across the street from me and all of my aunts (on my mom's side) live within a fifteen minute radius. Family barbeques are a weekly thing for me, we participate in a family baseball league, and we go on a family camping every year. I'm the person who would rather hang out with my sisters and cousins on the weekend than go to the mall with my best friends (not that I don't love shopping or my best friends).</p>
      <p>The second biggest time consumer for me is probably soccer. I have been playing all my life. In high school I played on three times and I play for my college now. Believe it or not, playing on my college team takes up just as much time as when I was playing on three teams, but it is worth my time. I have learned a lot from soccer and I am eternally grateful to all of my teammates and coaches for those lessons.</p>
      <p>The small percentage of the remainder of my time is spent reading, hiking, swimming, avoiding cooking, searching for new music, driving my siblings everywhere, and, I'll admit it, binge watching Buzzfeed videos.</p>
